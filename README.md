#  :black_nib: the glass down now
A professor began his class by holding up a glass with
some water in it.
He held it up for all to see; asked the students,’ How much
do you think this glass weighs?’
’50gms!’ …. ‘100gms!’ ……’125gms’ ……the students answered.
‘I really don’t know unless I weigh it,’ said the professor,
‘but, my question is:
What would happen if I held it up like this for a few minutes?’
‘Nothing’ the students said.
‘Ok what would happen if I held it up
like this for an hour? ‘ the professor asked.
‘Your arm would begin to ache’ said one of the students.
‘You’re right, now what would happen if I held it for a day? ‘
‘Your arm could go numb, you might have severe muscle
stress; paralysis;
have to go to hospital for sure!’ventured another student;
all the students laughed.
‘Very good. But during all this, did the weight of the
glass change?’ asked the professor.
‘No’ the students said.
Then what caused the arm ache & the muscle stress? ‘
The students were puzzled.
‘Put the glass down!’ said one of the students.
‘Exactly!’ said the professor.’ Life’s problems are
something like this .
Hold it for a few minutes in your head; they seem OK.
Think of them for a long time & they begin to ache.
Hold it even longer & they begin to paralyze you. You will
not be able to do anything.
It’s important to think of the challenges (problems) in your
life,but
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT to ‘put them down’ at the end of
every day before you go to sleep.
That way, you are not stressed, you wake up every day
fresh & strong & can handle any issue, any challenge that
!comes your way/
